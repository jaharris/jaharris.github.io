abstract = "The <i>let alone</i> construction (<i>John can't run a mile, let alone a marathon</i>) differs from standard coordination structures (with <i>and</i> or <i>but</i>) by requiring ellipsis of the second conjunctâ€”for example, a marathon is the remnant of an elided clause [<i><del>John run</del> a marathon</i>]. In support of an ellipsis account, a corpus study of British and American English finds that let alone exhibits a Locality bias, as the second conjunct preferentially contrasts with the nearest lexical item of the same syntactic type. Two self-paced reading studies show that the Locality bias is active during online processing, but must be reconciled with indicators of semantic contrast and discourse information. Further, a sentence-rating study shows that the Locality bias interacts with a Finality bias that favours placing the <i>let alone</i> phrase at the end of a clause, which sometimes necessitates a nonlocal contrast. Together, the results show how a general bias in ellipsis for local contrasts is affected by discourse demands, such as the need for scalar contrast imposed by let alone, thereby offering a window into how possibly divergent syntactic and discourse constraints impact sentence processing.<br><br>"

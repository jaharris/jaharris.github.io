abstract = "This paper investigates the syntactic and semantic restrictions on modal adjectives that appear in prenominal and postnominal position in English, as in <i>The stars visible include Capella.</i> It is argued that, contrary to many current approaches, such adjectives are not implicit relative clauses. It is proposed that such adjectives instead constitute an exceptional lexical class, and form a complex head with determiners that license resource situations. A novel compositional semantics for these expressions is offered which exploits the dependence on resource situations in the logical representation.<br><br>"

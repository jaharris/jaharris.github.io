abstract = "This paper explores the semantics of <i>else</i> when it modifies a bare quantifier, as in <i>someone else</i>, or a <i>wh</i>-phrase, as in <i>who else</i>. I argue that <i>else</i> triggers the presupposition that there is a contextually salient witness, which is removed from the domain of the quantifier it modifies. I also show that the presupposition can be satisfied in multiple ways: from prior text, from non-linguistic discourse context, and, as in the title, through an exceptive phrase like <i>but Sarah</i>.<br><br>"

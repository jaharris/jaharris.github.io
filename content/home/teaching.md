## Courses for 2024-2025

###  Spring 2025. Language Processing [Ling 132]

#### Course description:
> Psycholinguistics is a relatively young, but rapidly growing, discipline that addresses how language might be realized as a component within the general cognitive system, and how language is comprehended, produced, and represented in memory. It is an interdisciplinary effort, drawing on research and techniques from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science, and utilizes a variety of methods to investigate the underlying representations and mechanisms that are involved in linguistic computations.

> This course concentrates on (i) uncovering and characterizing the subsystems that account for linguistic performance, (ii) exploring how such subsystems interact, and whether they interact within a fixed order, and (iii) investigating how the major linguistic subsystems relate to more general cognitive mechanisms.

### Spring 2025. Pragmatic Theory [Ling 207]

#### Course description
> Pragmatics explores the systematic relation between what was intended and what was literally said by
examining what inferences can be made from a sentence meaning in a particular context of utterance,
given what is known about the speaker and the participants in the discourse. Once treated as a virtual
unstructured wasteland of non-linguistic information, pragmatics is reaching a new maturity as it
more closely interfaces with linguistic subsystems.
Pragmatic research addresses a notoriously broad domain. The course design emphasizes the theoretical components of pragmatics research, focusing on topics that highlight the internal structure of pragmatic mechanisms or the ways in which pragmatic information is embedded within the architecture of the language faculty. It also introduces methods and ongoing developments in experimental pragmatics, an area that has become a driving force in shaping research interests in the field.

> This course starts by reviewing the classic cooperative foundations of pragmatic theory initiated by Grice, and then highlights recent advances in the field, concentrating on numerous major topics of current interest, including (a) Pragmatic theory and implicatures since Grice 1975, (b) Projection and not-at-issue content, (c) Speech acts, common ground, and speaker commitments, and (d) Choice points in formalizing context, discourse, and speaker, among others topics.

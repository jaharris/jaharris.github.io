## Courses for 2020-2021

###  Spring 2021. Language Processing [Ling 132]

#### Course description:
> Psycholinguistics is a relatively young, but rapidly growing, discipline that addresses how language might be realized as a component within the general cognitive system, and how language is comprehended, produced, and represented in memory. It is an interdisciplinary effort, drawing on research and techniques from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science, and utilizes a variety of methods to investigate the underlying representations and mechanisms that are involved in linguistic computations.

> This course concentrates on (i) uncovering and characterizing the subsystems that account for linguistic performance, (ii) exploring how such subsystems interact, and whether they interact within a fixed order, and (iii) investigating how the major linguistic subsystems relate to more general cognitive mechanisms.

###   Spring 2021. Topics course: Proseminar on Modification and Subjectivity [Ling 254]

#### Course description:
> In this course, we will sample the vast (and rapidly growing) literature on modification. Long central to semantic theory, the issue has been addressed far less experimentally We’ll take a tour through key issues in how contextual information and subjective standards influence the interpretation of the thing modified. As context and subjectivity arguably pervade many levels of language, we’ll adopt a strategy of constraining our attention to items that encode or otherwise involve the calculation of contextual standards / perspective within local computation, primarily adjective-noun combinations. Much of the course will concentrate on predicates of personal taste, expressives and epithets. We will engage both theoretical and experimental literature throughout the course.

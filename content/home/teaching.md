## Courses for 2021-2022

###  Winter 2022. Language Processing [Ling 132]

#### Course description:
> Psycholinguistics is a relatively young, but rapidly growing, discipline that addresses how language might be realized as a component within the general cognitive system, and how language is comprehended, produced, and represented in memory. It is an interdisciplinary effort, drawing on research and techniques from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science, and utilizes a variety of methods to investigate the underlying representations and mechanisms that are involved in linguistic computations.

> This course concentrates on (i) uncovering and characterizing the subsystems that account for linguistic performance, (ii) exploring how such subsystems interact, and whether they interact within a fixed order, and (iii) investigating how the major linguistic subsystems relate to more general cognitive mechanisms.

###   Winter 2022. Linguistic Processing [Ling 213C]

#### Course description:
> The core areas of psycholinguistics include language acquisition, language perception, language production, language comprehension, language and the brain, and language disorders and damage. This course emphasizes depth over breadth, and so we will not delve into all of these topics. Instead, we will be focusing on just two areas of research: mental representations and processing of lexical units, and sentence comprehension. We start with the basics of lexical access and decision, exploring various models of the processes involved. We then move to an overview of classic models of sentence processing which vary according to a number of related properties such as the modularity/interactionism of information channels and the serialism/parallelism of processing. Finally, we discuss several topics in current and classical language research, including the filler-gap dependencies, semantic processing, and sentence production.

###  Spring 2022. Language in Context [Ling 8]

#### Course description:
> TBA

###   Spring 2022. Research Methods [Ling 239]

#### Course description:
> Linguistic research has always placed a high premium on data in various forms: native-speaker introspection, fieldwork, corpora, judgment studies, reaction time studies, eye movements, and electrophysiology, to name a few. As the empirical base of linguistics had evolved, community- wide standards for data collection and analysis have become increasingly important. This course provides a practical, hands-on introduction to research design and analysis, with an emphasis on experimental data collection, study design, and proper statistical analysis. Assuming no programming, statistics, or experimental background, the course will provide you with the necessary conceptual and practical tools for carrying out experimental research.

> By the end of the course, you should be able to design an experiment that uses an appropriate method and that minimizes confounds, for which you would be able to apply appropriate statistical analysis techniques. Students will work in groups to design an experiment or corpus study to be presented at the end of the course, on an issue relevant to their own research interests.

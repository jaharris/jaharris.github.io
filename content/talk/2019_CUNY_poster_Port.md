# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Cue-based retrieval models predict reduced retrieval accuracy when the retrieval cue overlaps with more than one item in memory (similarity-based interference, SBI). This study addresses the extent to which morphological gender and number interact with structural biases (Locality bias) during antecedent retrieval in Brazilian Portuguese sluiced sentences. The results of two self-paced reading studies indicate that both number and gender cues can generate SBI effects when the Locality bias is violated, corroborating previous findings (Harris, 2015, 2019). However, gender cues elicited earlier SBI effects than number cues did, suggesting that not all morphological cues have equal status in retrieval.<br><br>"

# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Expressions such as 'either' can be used in a correlative structure ('either...or') or as a quantifier ('either student'). Previous research found that sentence-initial correlative 'either' facilitated coordination processing by generating a prediction for clausal coordination. This prediction appeared even for quantificational uses. In the present study, a self-paced experiment found that correlative 'both' triggered a structural prediction sensitive to its syntactic position. In an eye-tracking experiment, however, there was no evidence of structural prediction when 'both' was unambiguously quantificational.  We conclude that while correlatives generate predictions about upcoming structure, predictions across correlatives are not equally strong.<br><br>"

# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Perspective shift allows speakers to utter content they may not fully endorse. We explore the interpretation of perspective shifting expressions with a study on Transparent Free Relatives (<i>Allen poured [what (is called/he calls) a beergarita]</i>) and orthographic Partial Quotation (<i>Allen poured a ‘beergarita’</i>) in a Speaker/Listener production-perception experiment. While PQ and TFRs with explicit subjects (<i>what he calls</i>) licensed shifted interpretations for the Speaker, only TFRs without explicit subjects licensed shifted interpretations for the Listener. We propose that PQ provides a less robust cue for perspective shift, even when the speaker attempts to prosodically mark it as non-speaker oriented.<br><br>"

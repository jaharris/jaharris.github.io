It has been proposed that readers are likely to misperceive a low frequency word as a highly frequent orthographically similar alternative, particularly when the alternative is supported by previous context (Perea \u0026 Pollatsek, 1998; Pollatsek et al., 1999; Slattery, 2009; Gregg \u0026 Inhoff, 2016). In such cases, the misperception may not be corrected until the reader encounters incongruent information. However, many of these studies place incongruent text directly after the critical word, confounding whether readers regress backwards in text to resolve their misperception or to halt forward text progression in order resolve a lexical level conflict between the word form and its competitor. In three eye tracking while reading experiments, we adapted materials from previous studies to include a post-critical spillover region to address this possibility. Two of these experiments were designed to permit an ex-Gaussian analysis of the distribution of first pass reading prior to disambiguating information. The evidence suggests that post-lexical competition-inhibition between orthographically similar forms can delay forward movement of the eyes as a competitor is inhibited. The possibility that misperception and post-lexical competition-inhibition arise from the same set of mechanisms is discussed.","tags":["reading","misperception","competition"],"title":"Contextual constraint and lexical competition: Revisiting biased misperception during reading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chie Nakamura","Jesse A.

We present two eye tracking while reading studies on focus-sensitive coordination structures, an understudied form of ellipsis which requires the generation of a contextually salient semantic relation or scale between conjuncts. However, when the remnant of ellipsis lacks an overt correlate in the matrix clause and must be 'sprouted' in the ellipsis site, the relation between clauses is simplified to entailment. Instead of facilitation for sentences with an entailment relation between clauses, our online processing results suggest that violating parallelism is costly, even when doing so could ease the semantic relations required for interpretation.","tags":["Ellipsis","parallelism","focus-sensitive coordination","sentence processing","scalar meaning"],"title":"Correlate not optional: PP sprouting and parallelism in 'much less' ellipsis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

The studies exploit the discourse-linking property of which-phrases in ambiguous sluiced sentences, like A teacher scolded Max or Dotty, but I canât remember which one, to explore whether the preference for more local correlates is modulated by the discourse status of the potential correlates. I propose a discourse economy constraint (Alternatives on Demand: Avoid positing new discourse alternatives without evidence), which interacts with structural constraints like locality. Evidence from several questionnaire studies, as well as three online self-paced reading studies, supports the predictions of a sentence processing model in which the discourse status of items in memory immediately impacts the retrieval of a correlate for the remnant of sluicing ellipsis and related constructions. In addition, the time point at which the interaction between processing biases appears is shown to depend on the strength or diagnosticity of the retrieval cues in which-phrase.\n","tags":["sluicing","sentence processing","interference","locality"],"title":"Locality and Alternatives on Demand: Resolving discourse-linked wh-phrases in sluiced structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

The current study provides evidence that L2 learners generate expectations for future input based on prosody and visual information.

More generally, the study shows how the currently under-utilized pupillometry method offers insights into spoken language comprehension.","tags":["poster","prosody","pupillometry","relative clause","attachment"],"title":"Investigating sound and structure in concert: A pupillometry study of relative clause attachment","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Chie Nakamura","Jesse A.

Pupillometry is increasingly used as a measure of language comprehension, finding increased pupil size for syntactically complex sentences (e.g., Engelhardt et al., 2010), violations of expected meter (Scheepers et al., 2013), and inadequate or misleading pitch accent (Zellin et al., 2011).Using materials from Kjelgaard \u0026 Speer (1999), we found that improper prosodic boundary location increases pupil size, which increased differentially when the syntactic structure was independently hard to parse. The findings suggest that prosodic mis-alignment created additional cognitive load during auditory sentence comprehension, confirming that prosodic boundaries are immediately incorporated into structural analysis. We discuss implications for theories of prosody-syntax alignment in real-time sentence parsing, along with methodological and statistical innovations afforded by this method.\n","tags":["talk","prosody","sentence processing","pupillometry","alignment"],"title":"Using pupillometry to assess prosodic alignment in language comprehension","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

In a small auditory corpus study of radio transcripts, we establish that such structures overwhelmingly occur with contrastive pitch accents on the correlate and remnant (the quiz and the final, or Danielle and Kayla), and that there is a strong bias to pair the remnant with the most local plausible correlate in production. In two auditory naturalness ratings experiments, we observe that marking a non-local correlate with contrastive pitch accent moderates, but does not fully overturn, the bias for local correlates in comprehension. We propose that the locality preference is due to a sentence-final default position for sentence accent, and that auditory processing is subject to 'enduring focus,' in which default positions for focus continue to influence the focus structure of the sentence even in the presence of overt accents.

The studies exploit the discourse-linking property of which-phrases in ambiguous sluiced sentences, like A teacher scolded Max or Dotty, but I canât remember which one, to explore whether the preference for more local correlates is modulated by the discourse status of the potential correlates. I propose a discourse economy constraint (Alternatives on Demand: Avoid positing new discourse alternatives without evidence), which interacts with structural constraints like locality.

We present a silent eye tracking experiment showing that increasing the weight of the matrix verb phrase with a particle or an adverbial facilitates recovery from misanalysis, as in The horse raced past the barn fell (down / suddenly), but does not protect the processor from the incorrect parse, in which raced is erroneously understood as the main verb rather than a verb within a relative clause. Following Fodor's (2002) Implicit Prosody Hypothesis, we suggest that additional weight after the main verb (fell) reduces the penalty for garden path by signaling the prosodic boundary appropriate for a full relative clause (Frazier \u0026 Clifton, 1996, 1998; Hirose, 2003). In addition, there were few differences between short but highly predictable particles (down) and long but less predictable adverbials (suddenly), where predictability was determined by a separate offline completion study. The results highlight the essential role that implicit prosodic constituency plays in garden path recovery, in that it provides structurally relevant cues identifying the source of misanalysis (Frazier \u0026 Rayner, 1982; Fodor \u0026 Inoue, 1994).\n","tags":["implicit prosody","prosodic weight","eye tracking"],"title":"Implicit prosody pulls its weight: Recovery from garden path sentences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

In support of an ellipsis account, a corpus study of British and American English finds that let alone exhibits a Locality bias, as the second conjunct preferentially contrasts with the nearest lexical item of the same syntactic type. Two self-paced reading studies show that the Locality bias is active during online processing, but must be reconciled with indicators of semantic contrast and discourse information. Further, a sentence-rating study shows that the Locality bias interacts with a Finality bias that favours placing the let alone phrase at the end of a clause, which sometimes necessitates a nonlocal contrast. Together, the results show how a general bias in ellipsis for local contrasts is affected by discourse demands, such as the need for scalar contrast imposed by let alone, thereby offering a window into how possibly divergent syntactic and discourse constraints impact sentence processing.\n","tags":["ellipsis","focus","eye tracking","reading"],"title":"Keep it local (and final): Remnant preferences in 'let alone' ellipsis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

The present study investigates let alone coordination, which is argued to require clausal ellipsis in the second conjunct. It is proposed that the processor always projects a clausal structure for the second conjunct for the ellipsis, obviating a general preference for a less complex conjunct. Experiment 1 consists of several sentence-completion questionnaires testing whether a DP or VP conjunct is preferred in let alone structures as in John doesnât like Mary, let alone (Sue | love her). The results found a bias towards VP remnants that was weakly affected by syntactic placement of the focus particle even, as well as by prior context. Experiment 2 examined the effect of remnant type on eye movements during silent reading, revealing only distinct processing patterns, rather than major processing penalties, for different remnant types, and a general facilitation when even was present to signal upcoming scalar contrast.\n","tags":["ellipsis","focus","eye tracking","reading"],"title":"Processing let alone coordination in silent reading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

Such a parallel matching procedure could in principle ignore the serial order or hierarchical structure characteristic of linguistic relations. I present an eye tracking while reading experiment that investigates whether the sentential position of a potential antecedent modulates the strength of similarity-based interference, a well-studied effect in which increased similarity in features between a target and its competitors results in slower and less accurate retrieval overall. The manipulation trades on an independently established Locality bias in sluiced structures to associate a wh-remnant (which ones) in clausal ellipsis with the most local correlate (some wines), as in The tourists enjoyed some wines, but I don't know which ones. The findings generally support cue-based parsing models of sentence processing that are subject to similarity-based interference in retrieval, and provide additional support to the growing body of evidence that retrieval is sensitive to both the structural position of a target antecedent and its competitors, and the specificity or diagnosticity of retrieval cues.\n","tags":["ellipsis","sluicing","retrieval","eye tracking","reading"],"title":"Structure modulates similarity-based interference in sluicing: An eye tracking study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katy Carlson","Jesse A.

A new type of locally coherent structure is established in Experiment 1, where a that-less complement clause is at least temporarily analysed as a stand-alone sentence when it corresponds to a prosodic phrase. In Experiment 2, reduced relative-clause structures like those in studies by Tabor and colleagues were investigated. As in Experiment 1, the root sentence (mis-)analyses emerged most frequently when the locally coherent clause corresponded to a prosodic phrase. However, a substantial number of locally coherent analyses emerged even without prosodic help, especially in examples with for-datives (which do not grammatically permit a reduced relative-clause structure for some speakers). Overall, the results suggest that prosodic grouping of constituents encourages analysis of a sub-string as a root sentence, and raise the question of whether all local coherence structures involve analysis of an utterance-final sub-string as a root sentence.\n","tags":["prosody","local coherence","root clauses"],"title":"Standing alone with prosodic help","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

It is proposed that a general conceptual economy principle, No Extra Times, discourages the postulation of potentially unnecessary times, and thus favours the interpretation quantifying over parts. Disambiguating an ambiguously quantified sentence to a quantification over times interpretation was rated as less natural than disambiguating it to a quantification over parts interpretation (Experiment 1). In an interpretation questionnaire, sentences with similar quantificational variability were constructed so that both interpretations of the sentence would require postulating multiple times; this resulted in the elimination of the preference for a quantification over parts interpretation, suggesting the parts preference observed in Experiment 1 is not reducible to a lexical bias of the adverb mostly (Experiment 2). An eye movement recording study showed that, in the absence of prior evidence for multiple times, readers exhibit greater difficulty when reading material that forces a quantification over times interpretation than when reading material that allows a quantification over parts interpretation (Experiment 3). These experiments contribute to understanding readersâ default assumptions about the temporal properties of sentences, which is essential for understanding the selection of a domain for adverbial quantifiers and, more generally, for understanding how situational constraints influence sentence processing.\n","tags":["quantification","semantic processing","adverbs"],"title":"Processing and domain selection: Quantificational variability effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

This paper examines extraction from the pseudo-coordination construction - a systematic violation of Rossâ (1967) Coordinate Structure Constraint - and its treatment in online processing. I argue that pseudo-coordination constructions are composed via Non-Boolean conjunction, a different conjunction operator than other, seemingly identical, coordinate structures. The exceptional nature of extraction from pseudo-coordination structures is argued to result from the fact that this operator does not semantically distribute an argument across conjuncts. I also propose an interpretive constraint on Non-Boolean conjunction, that localizes it beneath Aspectual projections. Two experiments are presented, the results of which are consonant with the basic predictions of this account.\n","tags":["islands","sentence processing","coordination","extraction","event processing"],"title":"Extraction from Coordinate Structures: Evidence from Language Processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seth Cable","Jesse A.

We find that the relatively subtle judgments informally reported in the existing literature on pied-piping can in fact be replicated in a formal experimental setting. The resulting data support the claim that (unforced) pied-piping of PPs in English is a para-grammatical phenomenon, and that P-stranding in English is (essentially) obligatory where it is possible (Heck 2008). Furthermore, these studies provide further evidence that informally reported judgments - even very subtle ones - can indeed be rigorously replicated using formal experimental methods.\n","tags":["pied-piping","questionnaire","syntax"],"title":"On the Grammatical Status of PP-Pied-Piping in English: Results from Sentence-Rating Experiments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

In that study, found that non-speaker-oriented readings were available even when unembedded, contra to the view that the relevant perspectival shifting is handled exclusively via binding by attitude verbs (Schlenker, 2003, 2007; Sauerland, 2007).  Our present goal is to better understand the nature of the factors governing perspectival anchoring and the ways in which they interact. To that end, we present results from a pilot study that provide an initial characterization of the ways in which speakers express their commitments to controversial appositive content when embedded under an attitude predicate. Our results suggest that speakers have a wide variety of prosodic and gestural devices at their disposal, which serve to contrast the speakerâs perspective from those of other agentsâ in the context.\n","tags":["expressives","appositives","experimental pragmatics","commitments"],"title":"Predicting perspectival orientation for appositives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

These claims have recently been challenged, most extensively by Amaral et al. (Linguistics and Philosophy 30(6): 707â749, 2007). We are convinced by this new evidence. The questions we address are (i) how widespread are non-speaker- oriented readings of appositives and expressives, and (ii) what are the underlying linguistic factors that make such readings available? We present two experiments and novel corpus work that bear directly on this issue. We find that non-speaker- oriented readings, while rare in actual language use, are systematic. We also find that non-speaker-oriented readings occur even outside of attitude predications, which leads us to favor an account based in pragmatically-mediated perspective shifting over one that relies on semantic binding by attitude predicates.\n","tags":["expressives","appositives","experimental pragmatics","commitments","corpus"],"title":"Perspective-shifting with appositives and expressives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

A recent analysis (Hulsey and Sauerland 2006, following Carlson 1977) argues that both structures are available to the grammar, and are typically licensed in distinct environments (1). If there are unique interpretations (LF representations) associated with the two structures, these interpretations should be dependent on the proper licensing of their respective structures (2). I present novel evidence supporting view (1), by showing that a semantic ambiguity for Concealed Questions, known as Heimâs ambiguity, in fact reflects the structural ambiguity of relative clauses. In particular, it is shown from several tests that while one reading (Reading A) is available whenever the Matching structure is licensed, another reading (Reading B) is available just in case the Raising structure is.\n","tags":["concealed questions","semantics","relative clauses"],"title":"On the Syntax and Semantics of Heim's Ambiguity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.

This study examined the online processing of one such class of expressions: concealed questions, in which the meaning of a complex noun phrase (the proof of the theorem) shifts to a covert question (what the proof of the theorem is) when mandated by a sub-class of question-selecting verbs (e.g., guess). Previous behavioral and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies have reported a cost associated with converting an entity denotation to an event. Our study tested whether both types of mean- ing-shift affect the same computational resources by examining the effects elicited by concealed questions in eye-tracking and MEG. Experiment 1 found evidence from eye-movements that verbs requiring the concealed question interpretation require more processing time than verbs that do not support a shift in meaning. Experiment 2 localized the cost of the concealed question interpretation in the left posterior temporal region, an area distinct from that affected by complement coercion. Experiment 3 presented the critical verbs in isolation and found no posterior temporal effect, confirming that the effect of Experiment 2 reflected sentential, and not lexical-level, processing.\n","tags":["concealed questions","MEG","neurolinguistics","eye movements","semantic processing","coercion"],"title":"The cost of question concealment: evidence from eyetracking and MEG","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse A.
